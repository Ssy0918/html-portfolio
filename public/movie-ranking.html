<h1>The Best Movies According to Shuyan Sun</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>This film taught me the lesson that people only died when they are forgotten, and reminded me the importance of family.</p>
<h3>Robot Dreams</h3>
<p>It is a film without actor's lines, but when the music of "September" goes on, it makes you feel touched.</p>
<h3>Delicious in Dungeon</h3>
<p>I love the DnD themed animes, this one is really funny, and showed me a new perspective to view adventures.</p>
